# Python Projects, Tasks, and Assignments

## Overview

Welcome to the **Python Small Projects** repository! This repository is a collection of various Python-based projects, tasks, and assignments that I have worked on to hone my programming skills. It includes everything from simple scripts and coding exercises to more complex projects. Each folder in this repository contains a specific project, task, or assignment along with its relevant files and a detailed `README.md` for that particular folder.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subdirectories, each representing a different project, task, or assignment. Here’s a general structure of the repository:

### python-projects-tasks/
#### project1/
  - project-script.py
  - README.md
#### task1/
  - task_script.py
  - README.md
#### assignment1/
  - assignment_solution.py
  - README.md
....
....
....

#### Explain The Structure
- **`projectX/`**: Each `projectX` folder contains a specific Python project. These projects may range from small utilities to larger applications.
- **`taskX/`**: Each `taskX` folder contains a coding task or exercise. These are often focused on practicing specific Python concepts or solving particular problems.
- **`assignmentX/`**: Each `assignmentX` folder contains solutions to programming assignments. These may include exercises from online courses, coding challenges, or academic work.

Each folder contains:
- Python scripts relevant to the project, task, or assignment.
- A `README.md` file providing details about that specific folder, such as the purpose of the code, how to run it, and any other relevant information.
