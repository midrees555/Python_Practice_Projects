# Factorial Calculator

This Python project provides a simple command-line application to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer. The program continuously prompts the user for input and calculates the factorial until the user decides to stop.

## Features

- **Recursive Factorial Calculation**: Uses a recursive approach to compute the factorial of a given number.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the user inputs a valid non-negative integer.
- **Process Continuation**: Asks the user whether they want to continue or stop after each calculation.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid input, including non-integer values and negative numbers.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/factorial-calculator.git
   cd factorial-calculator
