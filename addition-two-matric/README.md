# Matrix Addition in Python

## Overview

This project implements a simple matrix addition program in Python. It allows the user to input two matrices of the same dimensions, and then calculates and displays the sum of these matrices.

## Features

- User-friendly input validation ensures that only positive integers are accepted for matrix dimensions.
- The program checks for dimension compatibility before performing matrix addition.
- Matrices are displayed in a readable format with rows and columns aligned.
- The sum of the two matrices is computed and displayed.

## How It Works

1. **Input Dimensions**: The program first asks the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrices.
2. **Matrix Input**: The user is then prompted to enter the values for each element of the two matrices, `Matrix A` and `Matrix B`.
3. **Matrix Addition**: The program checks if the dimensions of the two matrices are the same. If they are, it adds the corresponding elements of the matrices.
4. **Display**: The original matrices and their sum are displayed in the console.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

### Running the Program

1. Clone this repository or download the `matrix_addition.py` file.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `matrix_addition.py`.
4. Run the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   python matrix_addition.py
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter matrix dimensions and values.

## Example

```bash
Enter number of Rows:
3
Enter number of Columns:
3

Matrix A:
Enter value for A[0][0]:
1
Enter value for A[0][1]:
2
Enter value for A[0][2]:
3
...
...

Matrix B:
Enter value for B[0][0]:
9
Enter value for B[0][1]:
8
Enter value for B[0][2]:
7
...
...

Resultant Matrix (A + B):
10  10  10
10  10  10
10  10  10
```
