# 📝 My Notes App – A Simple & Smart CLI Note Keeper

Welcome to **My Notes App**, a minimal yet powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) application developed using pure Python. This tool is built to simplify how you jot down, view, and manage your personal notes—all through your terminal.

Whether you're a developer capturing ideas, a student organizing concepts, or just someone who loves the command line, this app is designed to be fast, simple, and effective.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

📌 **Core Functionalities**  
- 🖊️ **Add Notes** – Type one-line notes directly in the terminal  
- 📖 **View Notes** – Instantly read your saved notes  
- 🧹 **Clear Notes** – Securely delete all notes with confirmation  
- 🔄 **Interactive Menus** – Navigate through choices with ease  
- 💾 **Persistent Storage** – Notes are saved in a local `.txt` file for later use

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. Launch the app by running the script
2. Choose one of the 3 main options:
   - `1` – Add a note (one line at a time)
   - `2` – View all notes saved so far
   - `3` – Clear notes (with confirmation prompt)
3. After each action, choose whether to return to the main menu or exit
4. All notes are stored in `my_simple_notes_app_file.txt`

## 💡 Why This Project?
This app was created to practice and demonstrate:

- Python basics (input, file I/O, functions, error handling)
- Modular CLI programming
- Real-world logic flow in a minimalist app

It represents a practical use case for organizing your thoughts efficiently and shows how much you can do with just the Python standard library.
